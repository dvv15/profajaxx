[Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin': Rest in peace to Bon Scott (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison (ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly' leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin': I'm with the band, ayy, ayy
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend, yeah, ayy (ayy, ayy)

Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (no bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out: ¡No más! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like: Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars? (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks)
LA bitches always askin': Where the coke at? (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (ayy)

Now he wants to start talking
"Go ahead, " when I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
"No, don't wanna, won't happen"
Pope is a rockstar
You take your clothes off
Heading for the last fight
Before our worlds part
We can wait forever for the world to untrack
We can wait forever for the worthwhile track
And oh, you want to start talking
Fall together, I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
We can always fight
You can be the highlight
Pope is a rockstar
Hoping on a late night
How you wanna start talking?
How you wanna start walking?
We can make a landslide, dive-in
We can let it all go, cave-in
You wanna start talking
(EL)
You know what I'm walking
Hoping and a-hoping that I won't cry
Hoping and a-hoping that I won't try
